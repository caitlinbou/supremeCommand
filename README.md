## Description
This project is a CLI using Node.js that takes input of employee information.  The input may be one manager and as many engineers and interns as desired. The information is then rendered into an html file for easy managerial access.

## Installation
This program requires Node.js and the installation of [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). You will also require the templates and libraries found in thie repository, though they may be adapted to meet your own criteria as you see fit.
## Usage 
Once inquirer has been installed and all files are in place, you run the "node app.js" command in the terminal and answer the prompts. When done adding additional employees, you select the option saying "no more employees to add" and an html file is rendered with all of the information that was input in the CLI.

## Tests
The tests are included in the repository, and are to ensure the class and subclasses are built accurately to allow for html rendering. They use [jest](https://jestjs.io/). In order to run them you must run "npm install jest". Once installed, you run the command "npm run test" in the terminal.
